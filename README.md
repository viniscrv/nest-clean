### Summary

The project consists of the back-end of a question-and-answer forum. In this project, the `NestJs` technology was used with the aim of exploring the possibilities of the framework. To achieve this, the entire architecture provided by the framework was utilized, employing Guards for authentication and other specific features of the tool. In addition to the opinionated architecture of NestJs, a `DDD architecture` was used for greater scalability of the project. Other relevant technologies used in the project include `Prisma`, `Zod`, and `Redis`.
